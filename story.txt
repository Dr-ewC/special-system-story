Flourescent light burned Scott's eyse as he oepened them.  His head pounded.  He could still taste the alcholol from last night. 
 He sat up and looked around an empty room.  Where was he?  A strange bald man appeared out of nowhere. 
 "Now Scott", the bald man questioned, "is a burrito a sandwich?".  Scott was dumbfounded, as his headache grew in intensity. 
 "I-I-I don't know", he stuttered out.  He had never taken the time to consider whether a Poptart was a ravioli, much less a burrito being a sandwich.
